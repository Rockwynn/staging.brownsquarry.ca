<h4>The result is a 100% granite aggregate.</h4>
<h4>Brown&#8217;s Quarry operates a diamond wire saw which utilizes the most advanced granite cutting technology. Stone is sawn on the beds to specific heights &amp; lengths. Alongside our cut granite products, we offer a complete line of natural stone in a variety of colors and thickness for a number of creative applications.</h4>
